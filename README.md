# D-Day Counter

This is a simple, single-page web application that acts as a D-Day counter.

## Functionality

*   It calculates and displays the number of days remaining until a target date (`D-` format), the number of days passed since a target date (`D+` format), or "D-Day!" if the target date is today.
*   When first opened, it prompts the user to enter a target date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
*   The target date is stored in the browser's `localStorage`, so it persists across sessions.
*   A "Reset Date" button allows the user to clear the stored date and set a new one.

## Technology

*   It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   The user interface is centered and styled with a clean, card-based design.
